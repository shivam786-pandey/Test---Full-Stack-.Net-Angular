# Basic .NET/C# Project with Angular Interface and GDPR Considerations

## Objective
This repository contains a small .NET/C# web application with a basic Angular front-end, integrating MongoDB, and considering GDPR compliance aspects.

Basic .NET/C# Project
- **Data Structure**: Define a simple entity `User`with basic attributes.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Implement Create and Read operations.
- **Angular Front-End**: Develop a minimal interface for adding (Create) and displaying (Read) the entities.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Use MongoDB for data storage and retrieval, demonstrating the use of compound indexes in MongoDB.
- **GDPR Considerations**: Implement basic GDPR compliance measures at the code and user interface levels.

Binary String Analysis Function
- **Functionality**: Write a C# function to evaluate binary strings based on specific criteria.
  - The function accepts a binary string as input.
  - Check if the binary string is 'good' based on these conditions:
    - Equal number of 0's and 1's.
    - For every prefix, the number of 1's is not less than the number of 0's.
