# Basic .NET/C# Project with Angular Interface and GDPR Considerations

## Objective
This repository contains a small .NET/C# web application with a basic Angular front-end, integrating MongoDB, and considering GDPR compliance aspects.

## Requirements

### Task 1: Basic .NET/C# Project
- **Data Structure**: Define a simple entity `User`with basic attributes.
- **CRUD Functionality**: Implement Create and Read operations.
- **Angular Front-End**: Develop a minimal interface for adding (Create) and displaying (Read) the entities.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Use MongoDB for data storage and retrieval, demonstrating the use of compound indexes in MongoDB.
- **GDPR Considerations**: Implement basic GDPR compliance measures at the code and user interface levels.

### Task 2: Binary String Analysis Function
- **Functionality**: Write a C# function to evaluate binary strings based on specific criteria.
  - The function accepts a binary string as input.
  - Check if the binary string is 'good' based on these conditions:
    - Equal number of 0's and 1's.
    - For every prefix, the number of 1's is not less than the number of 0's.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Task 1
- **Functionality**: Effective Create and Read operations.
- **Front-End Implementation**: Quality of the Angular interface and its interaction with the back-end.
- **Back-End Design**: Efficiency of .NET/C# code and API design.
- **MongoDB Usage**: Basic integration for data operations and use of indexes.
- **Code Quality**: Readability, organization, and documentation.
- **GDPR Awareness**: Implementation and description of GDPR considerations in code and user interface.

### Task 2
- **Algorithm Accuracy**: Correct identification of 'good' binary strings.
- **Efficiency**: Performance of the function.
- **Code Quality**: Structure and organization.
- **Testing**: Inclusion of test cases or examples.
